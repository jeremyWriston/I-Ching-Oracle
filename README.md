# I-Ching-Oracle
I Ching Oracle/Game Web App that I am using as a project to practice Git, API's, and DOM manipulation.

## Preliminary goals are:
  
  - Randomly generate an array for an I Ching hexagram, determine changing lines, and create second hexagram from resulting changing lines.
  - Access JSON data in API based on the binary of hexagrams
  - manipulate DOM to present JSON data from API

## Possible future goals are:

  - Allow user to create account
  - Save I Ching results to account
  - Add option to download results as PDF
